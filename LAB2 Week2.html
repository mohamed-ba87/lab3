                he UK's most vulnerable children and young people face unimaginable challenges.
                We've partnered with giving platform Benevity to raise funds for two charities -
                the NSPCC and The Children's Society – to try to help turn things around for them.
                You can help make a difference - please donate now.

            <p>Clive Swift, who has died aged 82, believed that unemployment was as natural, and possibly even as necessary,
                a part of an actor’s life as employment, enabling him to experience,
                feel and think afresh. He encountered comparatively little of it,
                however, working steadily on television as well as having a solid stage career,
                with the occasional film thrown in. It was on television as Richard Bucket,
                downtrodden husband of the petty snob Hyacinth Bucket (which she pronounced “Bouquet”)
                in the BBC series Keeping Up Appearances from 1990 to 1995 that he is likely to be most remembered. He appeared in more than 40 episodes of the TV sitcom.</p>
            <h3>Lorem ipsum subtitle text</h3>
            <p>Working with Patricia Routledge, who played his social-climbing wife, was an experience he found stimulating. He was able to suggest a man apparently so cowed that the idea of escape was simply unthinkable. Swift would often receive marital advice or encouragement from members of the public. He complained that lorry drivers beside him at traffic lights would shout out: “Why don’t you leave the old cow?”
                In real life Swift had married the writer Margaret Drabble in 1960. They were together for 15 years, and had two sons, Adam and Joe, and a daughter, Rebecca. When Drabble published her second novel, The Garrick Year, in 1964, about a woman married to an actor, Swift accepted that the character was a composite figure rather than based on him, but said he lived with the feeling that “you didn’t know what was going to happen next”</p>
